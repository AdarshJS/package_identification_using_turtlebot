## Overview

Robots have been used to improve efficiency in a various tasks in warehouses such as package handling, identification and organization. This project aims to simulate the use of Turtlebot in identifying packages with QR codes, in a warehouse setting. 

The simulation is implemented in Gazebo. ROS packages such as gmapping, and teleop_twist_keyboard are used for mapping the environment in the simulation, while move_base is used for navigation.
